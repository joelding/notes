#CHAPTER 3 INTERRUPT MANAGEMENT

_Events_,  or asynchronous occurrences, originate from the environment. Event can be detected via Interrupts or be polled. In the case of using interrupts, pay attention to the processing performed inside the interrupt service routine (ISR) and outside. Each ISR is normally desirable to be kept as short as possible. Events need to communicate with the main (non-ISR) code.

Only API functions and macros that end in ‘FromISR’ or ‘FROM_ISR’ should ever be used within an interrupt service routine.

A _Binary Semaphore_ can be used to block a _handler task_ of higher priorities. The handler task gets unblocked each time a particular interrupt occurs, effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt.

The majority of the interrupt event processing is implemented within the synchronized task; only a very fast and short portion remaining directly in the ISR. The interrupt processing is said to have been ‘deferred’ to a ‘handler’ task.

In the binary semaphore usage scenario, different from the other semaphores, the interrupt ‘giving’ the semaphore even though it has not first ‘taken’ it, and the task ‘taking’ the semaphore but never giving it back.

Example 12. Using a binary semaphore to synchronize a task with an interrupt

This example uses a binary semaphore to unblock a task from within an interrupt service routine—effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt. A simple periodic task is used to generate an interrupt every 500 milliseconds. In this case, a software generated interrupt is used because it allows the time at which the interrupt occurs to be controlled, which in turn allows the sequence of execution to be observed more easily. Listing 45 shows the implementation of the periodic task. mainTRIGGER_INTERRUPT() simply sets a bit in the interrupt controller’s Set Pending register.

adequate if interrupts can occur only at a relatively low frequency.

configUSE_COUNTING_SEMAPHORES must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for counting
semaphores to be available.

NUC472 interrupt priority:
The NVIC supports:
 An implementation-defined number of interrupts, in the range 1-240 interrupts.
 A programmable priority level of 0-16 for each interrupt; a higher level corresponds to
a lower priority, so level 0 is the highest interrupt priority.
 Level and pulse detection of interrupt signals.
 Dynamic reprioritization of interrupts.
 Grouping of priority values into group priority and subpriority fields.
 Interrupt tail-chaining.
 An external Non Maskable Interrupt (NMI)
 WIC with Ultra-low Power Sleep mode support

An engineer by training, he has developed many computer systems in railway control and other industrial applications and a wide range of software tools for embedded systems. Networking projects included Bitup, a Bitbus emulation for the 80188 processor; data transfer protocols using Arcnet and Ethernet; and a full 801888-based remote-boot communications system using the simpler TCP/IP protocols (UDP and TFTP). Recent work has been in implementing embedded TCP/IP systems in aerospace, air quality, and video surveillance applications.

Interrupts: events typically generated by hardware (e.g., peripherals or external input pins) that cause changes in program flow control outside a normal programmed sequence. 

When a peripheral or hardware needs service from the processor, typically the following sequence would occur:
1. The peripheral asserts an interrupt request to the processor
2. The processor suspends the currently executing task
3. The processor executes an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to service the peripheral, and optionally clear the interrupt request by software if needed
4. The processor resumes the previously suspended task

NVIC:  Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller, a unit for interrupt handling.
In addition to interrupt requests, there are other events that need servicing and we called them “exceptions.” An interrupt is one type of exception.

Other exceptions included fault exceptions and other system exceptions to support the OS (e.g., SVC instruction).


Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 NVIC supports up to 240 IRQs (Interrupt Requests), a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI), a SysTick (System Tick) timer interrupt, and a number of system exceptions.
