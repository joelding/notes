Jeremy Bentham, TCP/IP Lean: Web Servers for Embedded Systems, 2/E, CRC Press 2002

Jeremy Bentham comes from Cambridge, England. This book is a hands-on book about TCP/IP networking.

An engineer by training, he has developed many computer systems in railway control and other industrial applications and a wide range of software tools for embedded systems. Networking projects included Bitup, a Bitbus emulation for the 80188 processor; data transfer protocols using Arcnet and Ethernet; and a full 801888-based remote-boot communications system using the simpler TCP/IP protocols (UDP and TFTP). Recent work has been in implementing embedded TCP/IP systems in aerospace, air quality, and video surveillance applications. In his spare time, Jeremy enjoys playing racquet sports, and is an accomplished amateur actor.
