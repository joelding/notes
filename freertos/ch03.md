#CHAPTER 3 INTERRUPT MANAGEMENT

##HISTORY
-2015/01/13    init

_Events_ originate from the environment. For example, a packet arriving on an Ethernet peripheral (the event) might require
passing to a TCP/IP stack for processing (the action).

Event can be detected via Interrupts or be polled.

Only API functions and macros that end in ‘FromISR’ or ‘FROM_ISR’ should ever be used within an interrupt service routine.



A Binary Semaphore can be used to unblock a task each time a particular interrupt occurs, effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt.

The majority of the interrupt event processing is implemented within the synchronized task; only a very fast and short portion remaining directly in the ISR. The interrupt processing is said to have been ‘deferred’ to a ‘handler’ task.


void vSemaphoreCreateBinary(xSemaphoreHandle);
portBASE_TYPE xSemaphoreTake(xSemaphoreHandle, portTickType);
xSemaphoreGiveFromISR(xSemaphoreHandle, portBASE_TYPE*);
