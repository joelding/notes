#CHAPTER 3 INTERRUPT MANAGEMENT

*Events*,  or asynchronous occurrences, originate from the environment. Event can be detected via Interrupts or be polled. In the case of using interrupts, pay attention to the processing performed inside the interrupt service routine (ISR) and outside. Each ISR is normally desirable to be kept as fast and short as possible. Events need to communicate with the main (non-ISR) code. The interrupt processing is said to have been ‘deferred’ to a ‘handler’ task. Only API functions and macros that end in ‘FromISR’ or ‘FROM_ISR’ should ever be used within an interrupt service routine.

Interrupts
- events typically generated by hardware (e.g., peripherals or external input pins) 
- cause changes in program flow control outside a normal programmed sequence
- typical sequence: 
 - 1. The peripheral asserts an interrupt request to the processor 
 - 2. The processor suspends the currently executing task 
 - 3. The processor executes an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to service the peripheral, and optionally clear the interrupt request by software if needed 
 - 4. The processor resumes the previously suspended task

A *Binary Semaphore* can be used to block a _handler task_ of higher priorities. The handler task gets unblocked each time a particular interrupt occurs, effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt. Notice that in the binary semaphore usage scenario, different from the other semaphores, the interrupt ‘giving’ the semaphore even though it has not first ‘taken’ it, and the task ‘taking’ the semaphore but never giving it back.

Example 12 "Using a binary semaphore to synchronize a task with an interrupt" demonstrates the idea behinde a binary semaphore. This example uses a binary semaphore to unblock a task from within an interrupt service routine — effectively synchronizing the task with the interrupt. A simple periodic task is used to generate an interrupt every 500 milliseconds. In this case, a software generated interrupt is used because it allows the time at which the interrupt occurs to be controlled, which in turn allows the sequence of execution to be observed more easily. Listing 45 shows the implementation of the periodic task. mainTRIGGER_INTERRUPT() simply sets a bit in the interrupt controller’s Set Pending register.

A binary semaphore is adequate if interrupts can occur only at a relatively low frequency. A binary semaphore can latch, _at most_, one interrupt event. Any subsequent events, occurring before the latched event has been processed, will be _lost_. A *Counting Semaphore* can fix this issue.

configUSE\_COUNTING\_SEMAPHORES must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for counting
semaphores to be available.
