#CHAPTER 2 QUEUE MANAGEMENT

##HISTORY
- 2015/01/12    init

Applications running on FreeRTOS are structured as a set of independent *tasks*. Each task is itself a mini program. Tasks talk to each other via *queues* as communication and synchronization mechanisms.

A queue can hold a finite number of fixed size data items. The finite number is called its 'length'. A datum, a First In First Out (FIFO) buffer, is written to the end (tail) of the queue and removed from the front (head) of the queue. Writing data to a queue causes _a byte for byte copy_ of the data to be stored in the queue itself. Reading data from a queue causes the copy of the data to be removed from the queue.

Queues are objects in their own right that are not owned by or assigned to any particular task.  This means queues _can be accessed by all tasks_, and can not hidden between tasks.

An optional *block* time to read from a queue or write to a queue: Should the queue already be empty/full, the time the task should be kept in the Blocked state to wait for data/space to be available from the queue.
