Q: How to debug an existing GStreamer code or add debug messages?
A: Export the environment variable GST_DEBUG. A comma-separated list of category:level pairs, with an optional level at the beginning, representing the default debug level for all categories. The '*' wildcard is also available. For example GST_DEBUG=2,audio*:5 will use Debug Level 5 for all categories starting with the word audio. GST_DEBUG=*:2 is equivalent to GST_DEBUG=2.
