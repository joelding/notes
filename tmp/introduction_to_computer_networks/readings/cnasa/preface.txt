The only predictable thing about the Internet is constant change.

What are the underlying concepts and technologies that make the Internet work? The “why” of the Internet architecture/protocols lays the cornerstone for the Fifth Edition.

Audience: the graduate or upper-division undergraduate level, industry professionals, current network practitioners.

Changes in the Fifth Edition:

Approach: a perspective which authors call the systems approach.
	1. start with first principles and walk you through the thought process that led to today’s networks.
	2. not adopt a rigidly layerist approach
	3. illustrate how networks work in practice
