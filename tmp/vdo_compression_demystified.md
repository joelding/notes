#Predictive Coding

##Markov Sources
* A source where the probablity of a particular symbol value depends on previous values
* _first-order_ Markov: depending on the previous value only
* _second-order_ Markov: depending on two previous values
* Studying Markov Sources leads to Predictive Coding
* the difference between data and information: in an environment with a known structure, highly correlated data represent the structure. If the information can be separated from the structure, only the information needs to be transmitted.
