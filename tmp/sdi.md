#SDI
* abbreviated from Serial Digital I/O
* also called 270 Mbps, 360 Mbps, 540 Mbps, 1.5 Gbps, 3 Gbps Serial Interface
  * 270 Mbps Serial Interface
    * defined by BT.656 and SMPTE 259M interface
    * converts a 27 MHz parallel stream into a 270 Mbps serial stream
    * The 10× PLL generates a 270 MHz clock from the 27 MHz clock signal
    * primarily used for 480i and 576i 4:3 systems
    * a.k.a. SD-SDI
  * 360 Mbsp Serial Interface
    * defined by BT.1302 and SMPTE 259M interface
    * converts a 36 MHz parallel stream into a 360 Mbps serial stream
    * The 10× PLL generates a 360 MHz clock from the 36 MHz clock signal
    * primarily used for 480i and 576i 16:9 systems
  * 540 Mbps interfaces support 525p and 625p formats
  * 1.5 Gbit/s interfaces support most high-definition video formats, including 1080/60i, 1080/59.94i, 1080/50i, 1080/30p, 1080/29.97p, 1080/25p, 1080/24p, 1080/23.98p, 720/60p, 720/59.94p, and 720/50p
  * 3Gb/s SDI for Transport of 1080p50/60, 3D, UHDTV1 / 4k and Beyond
* primarily used on professional and studio video equipment

The above picture shows the parallel formats can be converted to a serial format, allowing data to be transmitted using a 75-Ω coaxial cable or optical fiber.
